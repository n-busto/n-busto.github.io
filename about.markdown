### Introduction

Hi, I'm Nicanor, a software developer that loves to arg about technology and development, I'm convinced that the technological stack you know is not relevant
to cover a new work with different technologies because since you have clear knowledge about software architecture, you will be able to adapt to this new stack
really fast, so I'm learning about it because I'm sure that is the better way to be a better developer.


### My path
- I'm currently trying to learn about architecture (the more I learn the more I figure out that there is a not ending path).
- I'm trying to learn new languajes and frameworks and improve my knowledge on the ones I know.
- My objective in the short term is to learn about cloud and frontend so I can be a fullstack developer.

### Tech stack

-   **Languajes**: Java, Kotlin, SQL, yaml, json, xml, markdown
-   **Technologies**: Spring boot, Maven, Gradle, JPA, Hibernate
-   **IDE**: Intellij, Eclipse, VSCode
-   **Tools**: Git, Postman, GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Clonfluence
-   **Other**: REST API, PostgreSQL, MySQL
