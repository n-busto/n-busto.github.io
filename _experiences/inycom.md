## Inycom

After that I learnt Spring boot üçÉ and I gone to a project on this technology, in this experience I was involved in some different projects, but mostly with the same stack until I end in a LTS project on Vert.x.

### Tech stack
- Spring boot (JPA, Hibernate, Web for rest services)
- Java 11, 17
- Vert.x
- Kafka with Avro schemas
- PostgreSQL
